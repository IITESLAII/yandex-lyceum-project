## Project Status

OrderService is a training project currently under development. The project demonstrates the use of multiple technologies, including `gRPC`, a `REST server`, `PostgreSQL` for data storage, `Redis` for caching, database migrations, a `Makefile` for task automation, and `Docker Compose` for container orchestration.

The following features are fully implemented:
- **CreateOrder**: Basic functionality to create a new order.
- **Logger**: Fully configured logging functionality for event and error tracking.
- **Docker Compose**: Complete containerized setup for development and testing.

The following features are planned but not yet implemented:
- **Order Retrieval and Management**: Additional gRPC and REST endpoints to retrieve, update, and delete orders.
- **Order Status and History Tracking**: Support for tracking order status changes and maintaining order history.
- **Redis Caching**: Enhanced Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Advanced error handling and input validation across services.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for improving service reliability.
- **Documentation**: Full API documentation and setup instructions for developers.
